							<h4>Kamiranzovu waterfall</h4>
							<p>Originating from the kamiranzovu marshlands within Nyungwe forest national park southwestern Rwanda, kamiranzovu waterfall has presently become a must visit for every traveler to the national park. Though Nyungwe forest national park has been commonly known for the chimpanzees, kamiranzovu waterfall has drawn much courtesy from the current travelers. The waterfall is divided into two parts, the lower part on huge rocks which is a beautiful spot for photography whereas the second side is in front of the falling water.</p>

							<h4>Primates trekking (chimps excluded)</h4>
							<p>Rwanda is renowned for its gorillas in the Volcanoes National Park, but the country is also home to chimpanzees as well a host of monkeys – colobus,  golden, L’Hoest’s, owl faced, Dent’s, blue and vervet – alongside olive baboons as well as the nocturnal potto and bushbabies.
							Chimpanzees are found in the Nyungwe National Park as well as in smaller number in the Gishwati Forest. Sociable creatures, chimpanzees live in extended communities and move around every day, foraging for food or occasionally hunting smaller mammals. They build fresh nests in the trees each night.

							<h4>Camping</h4>
							<p>The campsite at the park's reception centre is currently the only option at Uwinka. There are several choice spots, many with impressive views overlooking the forest and one on a wooden platform under a shelter that’s a godsend in the likely event of rain. The ablution block is cleaner than average, though showers (and toilets) come in buckets.</p>
