							<h4>Gorilla trekking</h4>
							<p>The mountain gorillas (Gorilla Gorilla Berengie), the world’s most endangered ape, is found only in small portions of protected afro Montane forests in northwest Rwanda, southwest Uganda, and eastern DRC.

							<h4>Muzanze caves</h4>
							<p>A rwanda safari without a tour to Musanze caves is undeniably incomplete. Situated in the heart of Volcanoes national park north western Rwanda, Musanze caves are surely worth visiting. Musanze caves were officially recognized as tourism products in Rwanda in 2013 and have since then become a must visit in Rwanda for a complete safari package. While on your Rwanda gorilla tour in Volcanoes national park, spare some time and visit Musanze Caves two kilometers long underneath. Rwanda tours to Musanze caves were introduced to market in 2013 by Rwanda Development Board(RDB) to diversify tourism products in this land of a thousand hills. </p>
