							<h4>Fishing on Lake Shakani</h4>

							<h4>Boat ride </h4>
							<p>Sunset boat cruises are offered daily out on to Lake Ihema, one of the largest lakes in Rwanda’s Akagera National Park. 

This one-hour boat safari is led by an experienced guide, who’ll take you out across the lake, to meander along the forest-fringed shores in the hope of spotting some of the 480 bird species identified in Akagera national park.
Akagera counts some rare and unique birdlife, including the iconic African fish eagle and large flocks of crowned cranes, along with the Carruther’s Cisticola, endemic to the wider Lake Victoria area.
There are also many hippos and crocodiles resident in the lake, plus the opportunity to see a variety of wildlife on the lake shores – often herds of buffalo wander down to the lakeshores, and individual topi make use of the nearby anthills to stand sentry.
