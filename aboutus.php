<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
The tourism industry has undergone rapid growth of unsurpassed nature over the last several decades. This has mainly been due to the advent of a 'borderless' world and increased information dissemination about the majestic sceneries throughout the world, with the eastern African region being no exception.<br><br>
We are on the brink of penetrating a profitable market in a rapidly growing industry. The current trend towards an increase in the number of tourists entering the country presents an opportunity for HAPA TOURS AND TRAVEL AGENCY to penetrate the market. An opportunity for HAPA   Tours' success exists because the national tourism industry is growing at a rapid pace annually. HAPA TOURS AND TRAVEL AGENCY is poised to take advantage of this growth and moderate competition in the city travel portion of the industry, with a dedicated and experienced staff, excellent networking, and effective management and marketing. HAPA TOURS AND TRAVEL AGENCY intends to provide travel and adventure packages to tourists primarily in the Eastern region, but also the whole of RWANDA. Services and products provided by HAPA TOURS AND TRAVEL AGENCY   will initially include pre-arranged tours, custom packages according to clients’ specifications, travel consultation, and making reservations for lodging amongst other related services. HAPA   Tours seeks to differentiate itself as a leading eco-photography and video coverage operator as an extra service to clients.<br><br>
